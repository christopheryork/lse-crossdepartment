* In Table 6.2, pages 15 & 18: "Accounting, Management" and "Social Policy, Economic History" are listed twice, with different values.

* In Table 6.2, page 18: "Social Policy, Sociology" and "Sociology, Social Policy" list different values.

* On page 16: The rest of this table (6.2) consists of pairs.  Is "Economics, Finance, Law" a typo?

* Similarly, on pages 19-20: A number of these entries are not simple pairs/dyads.  Given this, should we consider each course a single "link" (between multiple departments)?  Or a collection of links, between each combination of pairs of departments?

* Can we regularise these variants (in tables 6.2 & 6.4)? (or let me know if they are actually different academic units)

  - "Gender Institute" vs. "Gender"
  - "Social Psychology" vs. "Psychology"
  - "Geography and Environment" vs. "Geography"
  - "Media & Communications" vs. "Media and Communications"
  - "International Relations" vs. "IR"
  - "Philosophy" vs. "Philosophy, Logic, Scientific Method"
  - "Geography" vs. "Geography and Environment"

* Summing up the dyadic research links (table 6.2), I get slightly different numbers from table 6.1.  Any ideas?  I suspect I am misinterpreting table 6.2, as it seems like some pairs are missing (e.g. there is an entry for "Accounting, Economics -> 1", but no corresponding entry for "Economics, Accounting -> 1").

* I also get different sums for teaching links from table 6.3, but I suspect ironing out questions above may make these numbers line up.
